I've provided the files FetchStage.h and FetchStage.C.
Add the missing files: DecodeStage.h/DecodeStage.C,
 ExecuteStage.h/ExecuteStage.C,
 MemoryStage.h/MemoryStage.C,
 and WritebackStage.h/WritebackStage.C.
 For now, simply add the methods doClockLow and doClockHigh to each class, but leave the bodies empty.
 These functions will take the same parameters as the ones in the FetchStage class.
 Like FetchStage, these new classes will inherit from the Stage class.
